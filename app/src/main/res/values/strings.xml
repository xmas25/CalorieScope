    <string name="notice_text">* Since the pedometer sensor provides the data to the app, accuracy is dependent on the efficiency of the pedometer sensor. In case the pedometer is not present in the device, the accelerometer sensor is used which may have variable accuracy from device to device. You are advised to calibrate sensitivity settings according to your needs.\n\n* Since the heart rate sensor provides data to the app, accuracy is dependent on the efficiency of the heart rate sensor. In case of heart rate sensor is not present in the device, camera and flashlight are used to simulate the methodology and working of real heart rate sensor. This fallback mechanism is not very accurate and calculation may vary from device to device.\n\n* News is provided by newsapi.org, the app developer cannot verify or control the content of news.\n\n* Videos are provided in the app are from two YouTube channels.
